# codeQuiz
code quiz is a 5 question timed quiz that stores your score inside local store that can be accessed through a button named highscores in the upper left hand corner of the website or upon completion of the quiz. The index file starts the quiz with a start button which then renders each question one by one after each answer has been clicked on. If time runs out or there are no more questions left. Theres also a highscore file that has only one purpose and that is to get from local storage the highscores and render them for the user whenever they want to see it.
